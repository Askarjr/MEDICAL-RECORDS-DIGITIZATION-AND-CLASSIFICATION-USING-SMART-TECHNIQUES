# MEDICAL-RECORDS-DIGITIZATION-AND-CLASSIFICATION-USING-SMART-TECHNIQUES
This project proposes to design and implement a new website for clinics, medical centers, and hospitals. It aims to facilitate medical investigation and decision support systems by converting paper medical records into electronic records. On the other hand, the website contains a live video conference that connects the doctors in the operation room to give a second opinion.
